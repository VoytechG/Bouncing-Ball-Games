# [Bouncing Ball Games - Beginner JavaScript Programming Course](https://davidalmjali.wixsite.com/codingcurriculum)
Course prepared for a University College London project prepared by Wojciech Golaszewski, Cosmin Vladianu, David Al Mjali.

In this course, you will learn how to program from scratch a simple physics simulation of a Bouncing Ball, a Flappy Ball game based on iconic Flappy Bird, and a challenging Maze Ball game! We will explain every smallest piece of code line by line and everything you need to know to get started with programming, so you can easily, without any fear of having never programmed before, undertake the challenge!

## Overview

### Game programming course for everyone
We have created 3 JavaScript games using p5.js library and detailed tutorials on each game. The tutorials explain very basics of programming in JavaScript so that no external sources need to be used to complete all three tutorials without a course taker’s prior programming experience. With content of varied difficulty, the course is perfectly suitable both for absolute beginners and pupils already knowing basics of programming. 

### Fully self-contained course
Tutorials are created in a form of detailed step by step instructions on how to create every game. Each time a new JavaScript element is introduced (e.g. an array), it is explained how to use it, before a tutorial proceeds with its content. Besides, we have created an extra intro tutorial on how to create and run JavaScript projects, thus making the course fully self-contained. 

### Website – all tutorials in one place
Each of 4 tutorials (introduction and 3 games) are posted on a website we have created. Each tutorial is divided into chapters, every one of which shows step by step coding instructions and explanations, challenges for course takers to solve without our help, general tips in programming and model codes for course takers to compare their results with at end of each chapter. Besides a model code, every chapter’s last page includes an embedded running this code, so that everyone one can see both the code and what it should do.


## Games  	

### Bouncing Ball 	(8 Short Chapters)
A physics simulation including a ball’s vertical and horizontal movement, gravity influence, and energy losses on bounces from walls. The simulation involves user interaction with ball movements to make the program game-like (jumping, ac/deceleration of sideways movement).

JavaScript introduced: 	variables, if/else statements, or operators, functions, global/public/ private declarations, concept of an object.

Abstractions explained: gravity force influence on objects, energy loss on bounces, mathematical infinite ground bounce problem vs real life.

Controls: 	
- W – jump
- A – increase the ball’s speed towards left
- D – increase the ball’s speed towards right

### Flappy Ball 	(4 Long Chapters)
A game based on iconic Flappy Bird game. The game uses the same mechanics as in Bouncing Ball (vertical movement, gravity, interaction - jumping). The game is about avoiding hitting moving walls – player aims for holes in the walls, by making the ball jump with appropriate timing. Walls emerge from right screen margin, move fluently towards left margin, and disappear behind it. Games involves score display (score = number of avoided wall collisions) and possibility to reset upon loss (a collision).

JavaScript introduced: 	arrays, for loops, object-oriented programming, strings, booleans (true/false variable assignments)

Abstractions explained: operations on division remainders (not-named-so modulus operations), Pythagoras theorem 

Controls: 	
- W – jump

### Maze Ball 	    (5 Long Chapters)
A game with an obstacle course for the ball to beat. This game uses the same mechanics as bouncing ball with addition of obstacle corner collisions. Games involves platforms for the ball to roll and bounce on, and obstacles (both static and mobile) to avoid. Game ends when player reaches a marked destination. User Interaction involves making the ball jump up and sideways. 
Chapter 4 of 5 requires knowledge of trigonometry to be fully understood. However, because functions using trigonometry are given and it is explained what those functions do, this knowledge is not required to complete the tutorial of creating the game.

Abstractions explained: rolling friction, getter and setter methods.

Controls: 	
- W [hold] – jump at contact with ground
- A – move ball to the left
- D – move ball to the right
